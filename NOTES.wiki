How to check out and set up the latest version

As of March 6, 2023  
These commands will clone and build the most recent release of QuickChem on NCCS discover:  
  
mkdir QUICKCHEM_2023-03-06  
cd QUICKCHEM_2023-03-06/
git clone git@github.com:GEOS-ESM/GEOSgcm.git
cd GEOSgcm/
git checkout remotes/origin/feature/mmanyin/QUICKCHEM_DEV
parallel_build.csh -mepo -walltime 00:50:00 -q debug -account s1043 -no-tar

To set up an ECCOH experiment, first run gcm_setup.
Be sure to ask for Cascade Lake nodes.

If running with AMIP emissions,
/bin/cp <sandbox>/install/etc/AMIP/Chem_Registry.rc RC/

Then edit these 5 files:

===== RC/Chem_Registry.rc

doing_CH4: yes

nbins_CH4: 1

Add this as the first entry in variable_table_CH4:
CH4 'mol mol-1' Methane

===== gcm_run.j

Change the SLURM constraint to be:
#SBATCH --constraint="cssro&cas"

Add this line before the section "Rename big ExtData files"
/bin/ln -sf $EXPDIR/RC/Chem_Registry.rc .

===== RC/GEOS_ChemGridComp.rc

ENABLE_QUICKCHEM: .TRUE.

optional:
strict_child_timing: .TRUE.

===== RC/OH_instance_OH.rc

If OH_data_source is ONLINE_AVG24 and you don't have the 24-hr averages in oh_import_rst:

spinup_24hr_imports: T

Otherwise set it to F .

===== AGCM.rc

ADD THESE:
# How often to run OH:
OH_DT: 3600
# Set this to the HEARTBEAT in order to run OH during the first timestep of each OH_DT interval:
OH_REFERENCE_TIME: 000730

UNCOMMENT THESE:
OH_INTERNAL_RESTART_FILE: oh_internal_rst
OH_INTERNAL_CHECKPOINT_FILE: oh_internal_checkpoint
OH_INTERNAL_CHECKPOINT_TYPE: default

OH_IMPORT_RESTART_FILE: oh_import_rst
OH_IMPORT_CHECKPOINT_FILE: oh_import_checkpoint
OH_IMPORT_CHECKPOINT_TYPE: default


===== ALSO you may want to edit HISTORY.rc to include fields such as 'GOCART::CH4' and 'GOCART::CO' from GOCART, and 'OH' from OH
